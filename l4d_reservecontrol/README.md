Its puzzling how reserve ammo of weapons is tied to ammo type, and it annoys me when I try to change reserve ammo of weapons. To make CSS snipers have custom ammo counts without playing with ammo types and dealing with unknown gotchas, I made changing reserve ammo simple 'n clean.

Getting feet wet in building an efficient sourcemodding workflow with components like gamedata and config parsing was a journey.
